At their core, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people everywhere can enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\nThe goals are supported by a framework of global indicators that allow progress to be monitored and reported on. They cover a wide range of social, environmental, and economic issues, including, but not limited to, poverty, hunger, health, education, social equality, innovation, climate change, biodiversity, and justice, with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to leave no one behind. Governments are also encouraged to develop an implementation plan, which may include indicators developed to address specific contexts and priorities for achieving the SDGs.\n\nIn the Basque Country, the Basque Government has, from the outset, directed its efforts and projects towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the targets of the 2030 Agenda. Thus, Lehendakaritza leads the actions of the Basque institutions in relation to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nTo monitor progress towards the SDGs in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, Eustat – Basque Institute of Statistics carries out a specific statistical operation (see operation’s methodology file) and has developed the United Nations Global Indicator Framework indicator platform for the Basque Country and its provinces. A significant portion of the indicators has been defined using a methodology harmonized across all central statistical bodies of the Autonomous Communities, ensuring full and direct comparability of these indicators at the regional level ( Agreement of the central statistical bodies of the Autonomous Communities (pdf, 14Kb)). Also included, either directly among the United Nations indicators or as related indicators, are the European Union Sustainable Development Indicators as well as the Basque Country’s own indicators, developed in coordination with the Euskadi Agenda 2030 Forum to monitor the Lehendakaritza’s objectives.\n\nThe indicator framework is constantly expanding, both in number and level of disaggregation, in line with Eustat’s unequivocal objective of providing quality, integrated, and comparable information, both temporally and spatially, and adapted to the monitoring needs of our society.\n","id":""},"/en/en/aurkezpena/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/aurkezpena/","title":"Available information about the indicators\n","content":"Presentation of the indicators\n\nOn the homepage of this platform, by selecting each of the 17 Goals, you can access the targets established for each goal and the corresponding indicators.

In these cases, the indicator presented for the Basque Country is the closest available.\n\nThe relevant data for each indicator are presented in a graph and a table. For some indicators, this presentation is complemented by an interactive map showing data for counties or municipalities. Both new data and updates to already published data are added as soon as they have been obtained and verified.\n\nSome indicators cannot be represented using data. When this is the case, explanatory texts with links to thematically relevant information about the indicators are displayed.\n\nAt the bottom of each indicator page the following tabs are displayed:\n\n\n  \n    Methodological sheet: provides information on the indicator available in the Basque Country and how it is calculated.\n  \n  \n    Data sources: Links to the organization(s) that provided the data for the indicator and, where possible, direct links to the specific data sources.\n  \n  \n    More information: Contains the description and justification for the global or European indicator, an assessment of whether the indicator available in the Basque Country meets the requirements of the United Nations (or European Union, as applicable) indicator, and the international results.

En esencia, los 17 Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS) son un llamamiento universal a la acción para poner fin a la pobreza, proteger el planeta y garantizar que todas las personas en todo el mundo puedan disfrutar de paz y prosperidad.\n\nLos objetivos se sustentan en un marco de indicadores mundiales que permiten hacer el seguimiento e informar sobre los avances. Abarcan una amplia gama de cuestiones sociales, ambientales y económicas, que incluyen, entre otras, la pobreza, el hambre, la salud, la educación, la igualdad social, la innovación, el cambio climático, la biodiversidad y la justicia, con un enfoque en los más vulnerables y un compromiso de no dejar a nadie atrás. También se alienta a los distintos gobiernos a desarrollar un plan de implementación que pueda incluir indicadores desarrollados para abordar contextos y prioridades específicos para lograr los ODS.\n\nIndicadores disponibles en la C.A. de Euskadi\n\nPara apoyar la implementación interna en la Comunidad Autónoma de Euskadi de los ODS con los que el Gobierno vasco se ha comprometido, se ha desarrollado un marco de indicadores que incluye indicadores diseñados en coordinación con los organismos de estadística de las comunidades autónomas, e indicadores definidos por el Foro Multiagente de Transición Social y Agenda 2030 en Euskadi.\n\nSe intenta que los indicadores disponibles en la C.A. de Euskadi sean comparables con los indicadores del marco de indicadores mundiales de Naciones Unidas o con los indicadores de Desarrollo Sostenible de la Unión Europea. En el caso de que el indicador disponible en la C.A. de Euskadi no sea comparable con el indicador mundial o europeo, así se indica en sus metadatos.\n\nPresentación de los indicadores\n\nLos datos relevantes para cada indicador se presentan en un gráfico y una tabla. Esta presentación se complementa para algunos indicadores con un mapa interactivo que muestra los datos de las comarcas o municipios vascos. Sin embargo, algunos indicadores no pueden representarse a partir de datos. Cuando sucede esto, se muestran textos explicativos con enlaces a información temáticamente relevante sobre los indicadores.\n\nMetadatos y fuentes de datos para el indicador disponible e indicadores mundiales y europeos\n\nEn la parte inferior de las páginas de los indicadores se encuentran las pestañas “Ficha metodológica”, “Descripción del indicador” y “Fuentes de datos”.\n\nLa pestaña “Ficha metodológica” aporta información sobre el indicador disponible en la C.A. de Euskadi y su forma de cálculo.\n\nLa pestaña “Descripción del indicador” contiene la descripción y la justificación del indicador mundial o europeo, una evaluación de si el indicador disponible en la C.A. de Euskadi cumple o no los requisitos del indicador de Naciones Unidas (o Unión Europea en su caso), y los resultados a nivel internacional. En “Descripción del indicador” también se encuentra un documento PDF para cada indicador que contiene información sobre el cálculo del indicador mundial.\n\nEn “Fuentes de datos” se encuentran enlaces a la organización u organizaciones que proporcionaron los datos para el indicador y, cuando es posible, enlaces directos a las fuentes de datos específicas.\n\nEvaluación del progreso en los ODS\n\nLa plataforma incorpora un informe de seguimiento que proporciona una descripción general del progreso en la consecución de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS) en la Comunidad Autónoma de Euskadi. \nPara saber más sobre el procedimiento para evaluar el progreso, ver  Metodología para la medición del progreso.\n\n¿Cada cuánto tiempo se actualizan los datos?\n\nSe agregan datos tan pronto como se hayan obtenido y verificado. Esto incluye datos nuevos y actualizaciones de los datos que ya están publicados.\n\n¿A quién está dirigido este sitio web?\n\nEste sitio está dirigido a las distintas administraciones para la toma de decisiones sobre políticas públicas, a los ciudadanos interesados, y analistas de datos.\n\nComunidades Autónomas que informan sobre los indicadores de la Agenda 2030\nLa siguiente lista muestra las Comunidades Autónomas que informan sobre los indicadores de la Agenda 2030:\n\n\n  Andalucía: Indicadores de los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible de Andalucía \n  Aragón: Indicadores de los ODS de Aragón \n  Asturias, Principado de: Indicadores de los ODS de Asturias \n  Baleares, Islas: Indicadores de los ODS de las Islas Baleares \n  Canarias: Indicadores de los ODS de Canarias \n  Cantabria: Indicadores de los ODS de Cantabria \n  Castilla-La Mancha: Indicadores de los ODS de Castilla-La Mancha \n  Castilla y León: Indicadores de los ODS de Castilla y León \n  Cataluña: Indicadores de los ODS de Cataluña \n  Comunidad Valenciana: Indicadores de los ODS de la Comunidad Valenciana \n  Extremadura: Indicadores de los ODS de Extremadura \n  Galicia: Indicadores de los ODS de Galicia \n  La Rioja: Indicadores de los ODS  de La Rioja \n  Madrid, Comunidad de: Indicadores de los ODS de la Comunidad de Madrid \n  Murcia, Región de: Indicadores de los ODS de Murcia \n  Navarra, Comunidad Foral de: Indicadores de los ODS de Navarra \n\n\nPaíses que informan sobre los indicadores de la Agenda 2030\nLa siguiente lista muestra algunas de las plataformas sobre los ODS de los distintos países.

Progress measurement\n\nMeasuring and tracking progress with reliable information is key to understanding how the Basque Country is progressing toward achieving the SDGs.\n\nClosely measuring the progress of each indicator not only illustrates where progress is being made, or in which areas progress is lacking and efforts can be focused, but also allows for open and transparent communication on how the Basque Autonomous Community is doing in implementing the 2030 Agenda. The monitoring report can serve as a tool to better understand the success of policies and actions in achieving the various goals. It can also act as a clear signal so that effective, evidence-based policies can be adjusted or developed to help ensure the objectives are met.\n\n2. Methodology\n\nIn order to provide a simple and transparent assessment, a methodology has been developed based on the 2023 Progress Chart Technical Note used by the United Nations Statistics Division.\n\nWhen assessing SDG progress, the normative direction of a data series indicates the desirable outcome for its value. A higher value is desirable for data series with an increasing normative direction; the opposite is true for those with a decreasing normative direction. The desired direction for each indicator or series is taken from the Technical Note on Progress Assessment 2024\n\nAn indicator may contain multiple data series and/or breakdowns by different dimensions (such as age, sex, location, etc.). In these cases, only the data from the series and breakdowns that best represent the entire population of the Basque Autonomous Community are selected to assess progress.\n\nThe objective set globally by the United Nations is being applied at the level of the Basque Country.\n\nThe assessment assigns a score to each indicator. A distinction is made between indicators that have numerical targets for 2030 and those that do not.\n\n2.1 Indicators with target values ​​for 2030\n\nFor indicators with target values ​​for 2030 and at least two different data points (one for the baseline, usually 2015, and one for the latest year), a score is assigned by calculating growth rates. First, the actual compound annual growth rate (𝐶𝐴𝐺𝑅𝑎) is calculated between the reference year (b) and the latest year (t) for which data are available:\n\n\\[CAGR_{a} = \\left( \\frac{v_{t}}{v_{b}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{t-b}} - 1\\]\n\nThe 𝐶𝐴𝐺𝑅𝑎 from the previous step is then used to extrapolate the expected value (𝑣2030𝑒) for the series in 2030, assuming the current rate of progress is maintained:\n\n\\[v_{2030}^{e} = v_{t} \\times (1 + CAGR_{a})^{2030 - t}\\]\n\nFinally, a score is assigned to the series according to the following criteria:\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-fymr{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Score\n    Condition\n  \n\n\n  \n    3\n    $\\frac{v_{2030}^{e} - v_{b}}{v_{2030} - v_{b}} \\geq 0.95$\n  \n  \n    2\n    $0.10 \\leq \\frac{v_{2030}^{e} - v_{b}}{v_{2030} - v_{b}} &lt; 0.95$\n  \n  \n    1\n    $\\frac{v_{2030}^{e} - v_{b}}{v_{2030} - v_{b}} &lt; 0.10$\n  \n\n\n\nWhere:\n \n$𝑏$ is the base year (usually 2015)\n$𝑡$ is the last year for which there is data (for example: 2022)\n$𝑣_{b}$ is the base value in year b\n$𝑣_{𝑡}$ is the value of the last year 𝑡\n$𝑣_{2030}$ is the target value for 2030\n$𝑣_{2030}^{e}$ is the expected value for 2030\n\n2.2 Indicators without numerical target values\n\nIndicators without target values ​​for 2030, and with at least two data points, are scored by calculating the compound annual growth rate. First, the actual compound annual growth rate (𝐶𝐴𝐺𝑅𝑎) is calculated between the baseline (b) and the last year (t) for which data are available:\n\n\\[CAGR_{a} = \\left( \\frac{v_{t}}{v_{b}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{t - b}} - 1\\]\n\nThe indicator is then scored according to the following criteria:\n\nIf an increase is desirable:\n\n\n\n  \n    Score\n    Condition\n  \n\n\n  \n    3\n    $\\text{CAGR}_{a} \\geq 0.02$ \n  \n  \n    2\n    $0.005 \\leq \\text{CAGR}_{a} &lt; 0.02$\n  \n  \n    1\n    $\\text{CAGR}_{a} &lt; 0.005$\n  \n\n\n\n\nIf a decrease is desirable:\n\n\n\n  \n    Score\n    Condition\n  \n\n\n  \n    3\n    $\\text{CAGR}_{a} \\leq -0.02$ \n  \n  \n    2\n    $-0.02 &lt; \\text{CAGR}_{a} \\leq -0.005$ \n  \n  \n    1\n    $\\text{CAGR}_{a} &gt; -0.005$\n  \n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, the series values ​​are growth rates (e.g., Indicator 8.1.1: Annual growth rate of GDP per capita). Calculating the CAGR from growth rates would be meaningless, and expert judgment is used to assign scores.\n\n2.3 Progress Categories\n\nThe assigned progress categories are described below:\n\n\n\n  \n    Score\n    Category\n    Symbol\n  \n\n\n  \n    3\n    On track or target met\n    \n  \n  \n    2\n    Fair progress, but acceleration needed\n    \n  \n  \n    1\n    Stagnation or regression\n    \n  \n  \n     - \n     No assessment \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n2.3.1 On track or target met\nThe goal has been achieved or is on track to be achieved by 2030.\n\n2.3.2 Fair progress, but acceleration needed\nThere has been progress on the indicator, but to reach the target by 2030 it is necessary to accelerate progress.\n\n2.3.3 Stagnation or regression\nThere has been no progress or regression and it is unlikely that the target will be reached by 2030.\n\n2.3.4 No assessment\n\nIn some cases it is not possible to measure progress reliably or objectively:\n\n\n  When the indicator available for the Basque Country is not aligned with the official United Nations indicator methodology. In these cases, a proxy or substitute measurement is used, but sometimes it does not measure the same thing.\n  When there is not enough time series to assess progress.\n  When a decontextualized assessment is not possible, given the complexity of the issue. For example, this is the case with indicator 2.c.1, Food Price Anomaly Indicator. This indicator aims to measure a country’s performance in maintaining stable market prices, but when prices rise sharply due to the international situation (for example, in 2023-2024), the country does not have much capacity to maintain prices.\n\n\n2.3.5 No data available\n\nThere is currently no data for this indicator, but various sources are being studied to provide data in the near future.\n\n2.3.6 Not applicable\n\nCertain indicators cannot be applied to the Basque Country for various reasons:\n\n\n  Not applicable, due to its level of development: For example, indicator 10.6.1 Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international organizations is not appropriate for the Basque Country, since it is not a developing country.\n  What is to be measured does not exist or is not significant: for example, indicator 3.3.3 Incidence of malaria per 1,000 inhabitants is not applicable, since it is a tropical disease, non-existent in the Basque Country.\n  It refers to a standard or institutional structure that does not apply to the Basque Country: for example, indicator 12.4.1 Number of parties to international multilateral environmental agreements on hazardous waste and other chemicals that comply with their commitments and obligations to transmit information as required by each of these agreements, refers to an international agreement signed by the states, so it cannot be applied to the Basque Country.\n  They are global measurement indicators: for example, indicator 17.10.1 Weighted average world tariff.\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Considerations and exceptions\nDue to the nature of the data, a number of considerations and exceptions have been defined:\n\n\n  When the value of the last year meets the target, the goal is considered to have been reached, regardless of the trend in recent years.\n  When the value of the last year is close (maximum difference of 1%) to 0% or 100%, this being the objective, it is considered that the target has been reached.\n  When there is no data in 2015, the first available year after or before 2015 that allows having at least 2 values ​​is used.\n  In the absence of a specified target date, 2030 is assumed to be the target period.\n  If the target year is in the past, it is evaluated using the methodology with a target up to the target year  (y).\n  A minimum of two years of data is required to calculate the progress measure.\n  Progress estimates oversimplify reality. Progress needs to be contextualized with other relevant information.\n  It takes time for data to reflect the impact of policies; the longer the time series, the better the methodology for measuring progress.\n  Binary indicators will be assigned one of these 2 categories:\na. “Target met” if “yes”. \nb. “Stagnation or regression” if “no”.\n  Specific exceptions:\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Indicator number\n    Indicator title\n    Target\n  \n\n\n  \n    1.a.2\n    Proportion of total government spending on essential services (education, health and social protection)   \n    The EU average has been considered as a target for the indicator \n  \n  \n    5.4.1 \n    Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location \n    In order to calculate progress towards the goal of equitable sharing of parental roles and family responsibilities, the ratio of women's time to men's time is assessed, with a desired target of 1\n  \n\n\n","id":""},"/en/en/nazioartea/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/nazioartea/","title":"SDG in International Organizations\n","content":"United Nations\n\n  \n    SDG Global Database\n  \n  \n    Sustainable Development Goals Report 2024\n  \n  \n    E-Handbook on Sustainable Development Goals Indicators\n  \n\n\nEuropean Union\n\n  \n    European Comission Indicators\n  \n  \n    Eurostat Data Base\n  \n  \n    Monitoring report on progress towards the SDGs in an EU context - 2025\n  \n  \n    Overview of progress towards the SDGs in an EU context - 2025\n  \n\n","id":""},"/en/en/plataforma/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/plataforma/","title":"Acerca de la plataforma web\n","content":"Sustainable Development Indicators Platform\n\nEustat has developed this interactive platform for visualizing Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators using the Open SDG Platform, an open-source solution designed to facilitate the dissemination of SDG data.\n\nThis website is reusable.
